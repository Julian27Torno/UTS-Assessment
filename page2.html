        Life is not fair and it will not always be, we should always strive to become better because nothing is sure in life. I can say this because I saw my mom worked her way up and then got drag back in rock bottom. I want to avoid the mistakes that she chose. Whenever life throws rocks at me, I always stay positive no matter what. In order to cope with my current situation, I always pray to God. Back then I don’t really pray when I’m facing a problem but now that I got older, I realized that, I have nothing to lose when I pray to God. We need to develop emotional Intelligence in order for us to recognize and manage our emotions effectively.
